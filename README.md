# Merge Battle

this used to be (sort of) hosted at statsbuffet.party, but since that site is now defunct, I thought I'd bring back the interesting bit...

me versus Steve Purcell!

## background

I thought it would be cool to look at github contributions by number of unique repos that a particular user has merged a PR into, if those repos were not owned by the user.

What came out of this analysis is that Steve Purcell is single-handedly holding the entire internet together.

This is my homage to him.

## current state of things

Just going to make a single static site that can be updated daily to track how much more profilic of a contributor Steve Purcell is than anyone else in the entire universe.

Last time I was looking at this, I think I had around 400, and he had around 600...

At time of writing this README, I've now got 500-ish, and he's at 1000+.

The rivalry is not going well.
